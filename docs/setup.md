# Project Setup

If you plan on doing anything beyond perusing code, you'll want to get set up with a local copy of the project.

If you are an Adobe employee and plan to contribute code, please follow the instructions found in the [GitHub Adobe Org Management document](https://git.corp.adobe.com/OpenSourceAdvisoryBoard/handbook/blob/master/GitHub-Adobe-Org-Management.md#request-access-to-our-adobe-github-org) to obtain write access to the repository. When you must indicate a team to which your user should be added, please enter `adobe|UnifiedJS`. Preferably, you will make pull requests through the main repository rather than a fork.

If you are not an Adobe employee and plan to contribute code, please [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and make code changes on your fork.

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you already have node installed, be sure it is version 12.12.0 or higher.
1. Clone this repository. If you are an Adobe employee, you will do this by running `git clone git@github.com:adobe/alloy.git`. If you are not an Adobe employee and have your own fork, the git address will be specific to your fork.
1. After navigating into the project directory, install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
